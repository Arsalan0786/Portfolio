                    Hello there! I'm Sheikh Arsalan Originally from Kashmir, I'm now based in the Lovely Professional University(LPU) persuing my CSE bachelor's degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My curiosity for computers began at an early age, which naturally led me to pursue a career in tech. My journey is fueled by a relentless curiosity and a love for growth, whether it’s diving deep into algorithms or exploring the world beyond my comfort zone
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside my coding journey, I play football, football isn’t just a sport for me, it’s a way to connect, compete, and keep my mind sharp. Traveling is my escape and inspiration, as I enjoy immersing myself in new cultures, meeting diverse people, and collecting experiences that shape my worldview. Books are my sanctuary, offering me adventures and wisdom within their pages 
                </p>
                <p>
                     ’m also a lifelong learner, driven to master new languages and acquire unique skills that challenge and empower me. With a foot in technology and a heart open to the world, I’m constantly pushing boundaries to craft a life that’s as dynamic as my aspirations. When I'm not at my desk, you can find me at the gym :)
