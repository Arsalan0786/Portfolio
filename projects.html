      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>This project was created to provide a comprehensive and interactive overview of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dashboard was built using Django and Plotly.js, and featured a fully interactive map made using Mapbox. The project was open source and received over 200k visitors, but the most rewarding part was the collaboration with contributors across the world.</p>

      <h2>Mobile First Design</h2>
      <p>I designed the dashboard with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the application was responsive to all platforms and viewports. Thankfully Plotly and Mapbox are already mobile responsive to multi-touch interactions so it was just a matter of ensuring the overall layout was adaptable.</p>
